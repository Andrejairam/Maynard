Repo for augmented reality glasses project. 
Hey everyone,

**About Me:**
  My name is Andre Jairam. I've been out of work for as of today 1.5 years. I have a background in cloud computing with 7+ years at Microsoft as a TPM. I started this work back in 2014/2015 with a start-up called ARECA, which stands for Augmented Reality Embodied Conversational Agents. This was a project that added superimposed images onto your physical surroundings. I was inspired by the 3d camera from the Nintendo 3DS and Yelp's monocle app. I chose to focus on my college degree instead of the start-up. From there, I struggled to finish school and worked in Microsoft retail, writing white papers on different technologies. One of the papers leveraged the Intel Kaby Lake-G architecture. Paper got the attention of a partner at Microsoft Corporate, who gave me a chance to work in the cloud. Please be patient with my coding ability and really understand how to code Swift, Flutter, Radxa, and Armbian technologies. 

**AR Project:**
  This project centers on utilizing the Radxa Zero 3W as a base. The 3W has a few notable features that made it attractive for this project. 
    1. HDMI support: The Rockchip RK3566 SoC has a quad-core ARM processor that supports H.264/H.265 encoder up to 1080P@60fps. There is a micro HDMI port that we will use for the proof of concept. Future iterations will see this being removed for a better interface on a custom pcb. For now we will use an HDMI driver breakout board. 
    2. Wireless support: Core of this project is the wireless capabilities of IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax or wifi 6. This board also has an onboard antenna that will be more than enough for us but options to extend the antenna connector. In future iterations, we should be able to leverage the Ansys HFSS antenna permiation simulation test that can show us the best area for when we create the physical headset/glasses. 
    3. USB support: for the proof of concept, we will leverage the USB Type-C interface, but as we move to creating a custom PCB we will find ways to leverage this interface for input controls.
